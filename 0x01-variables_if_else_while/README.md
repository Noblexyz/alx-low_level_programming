Program Description

This is a simple C program that showcases the use of a variable, if-else statements, and a while loop. The program prompts the user to enter an integer and checks if it's positive, negative, or zero using an if-else statement. The program will continue to prompt the user for a new integer until they enter zero, which will terminate the program.
